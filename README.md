University of JSON Student System

The client requires a system to keep track of student information as well as course assignments and grading.

The table structure is already created (you will be given scripts). 

Your task is to create an API and front end to interact with the data.

The student fields are as follows:

{
id,
first,
last,
age,
address,
city,
state,
zip,
email,
gradYr

}

course is simply the course name and id

grades stores a grade value and id

roster pulls the previous three tables together to look up studentid, courseid and gradeid

No login is needed, this is an interal app and anyone with the link can use it.

A user should be able to add, edit and delete students. 

A user should be able to add, edit and delete courses.

A user should be able to add, edit and delete a grade.

A user should be able to view and edit the entire roster.

When stuck please ask questions of the developer of your choice.

No MVC plz. Use C# / Entity Framework for API and Angular 2 & Typescript and Bootstrap 4 for front end.

Other than those use any library you wish such as ngBootstrap uiGrid or others

Do not work on project at home.

Do not overstress, we are all trying to learn and asses where we are in our journey with new tech stacks.

The UI can be as simple or fancy as you wish, but functionality and speed is the main focus.

The front end and back end may be in the same project or solution, developer choice.

When finished, deploy project to a folder on test which may be accessed by anyone here at Typhon. (This means creating a virtual directory in IIS for the web API btw)

The time estimate is 2 weeks.

Like with any project for a client, it’s good to check in periodically so we will assess where we are in 1 weeks’ time.

Get coding.
